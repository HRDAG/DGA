\title{Three List Venn Diagram}
\usage{
venn3(
  overlap.counts,
  main = NULL,
  num.test.points = 1e+05,
  p.cex = 0.75,
  write_numbers = FALSE,
  t.cex = 1.25,
  cex.main = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlap.counts}{A vector of length \code{2^3} that gives the number of
records in each overlap in lexicographic order, i.e. 001, 010, 011, 100,
etc.}

\item{main}{the title of the graph}

\item{num.test.points}{how many test points to generate as potentials to be
plotted in the circles.}

\item{p.cex}{the size of the points to be plotted}

\item{write_numbers}{indicates whether to print the number of points in each
region.}

\item{t.cex}{the size of the text to write the numbers.}

\item{cex.main}{the size of the title}
}
\value{
a 3-way venn diagram with points inside of each segment representing
the number of records on each list overlap.
}
\description{
A function that plots a venn diagram of 3 lists. One point is plotted in
each region for each record that falls into the corresponding list overlap.
}
\examples{


overlap.counts <- rpois(8, 30)
venn3(overlap.counts, main = "example diagram")
