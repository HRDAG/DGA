\title{Four List Venn Diagram}
\usage{
venn4(
  overlap.counts,
  main = NULL,
  num.test.points = 1e+05,
  p.cex = 0.75,
  cex.main = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlap.counts}{A vector of length \code{2^4} that gives the number of
records in each overlap in lexicographic order, i.e. 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011,
0100, etc.}

\item{main}{the title of the graph}

\item{num.test.points}{how many test points to generate as potentials to be
plotted in the circles.}

\item{p.cex}{the size of the points to be plotted}

\item{cex.main}{the size of the title}
}
\value{
A venn diagram of the list overlap structure for four lists. Each
region of the plot contains points representing each record in that list
intersection.
}
\description{
A function that plots a venn diagram of 4 lists. One point is plotted in
each region for each record that falls into the corresponding list overlap.
}
\examples{


overlap.counts <- rpois(16, 50)
venn4(overlap.counts, main = "example diagram")
